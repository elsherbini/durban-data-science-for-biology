Oftentimes parameter and arugument are used interchangably, even though techincally parameter refers to the variable and argument refers to the value.\nAssignment operator: Symbol that assigns values on the right to an object on the left. Looks like &lt;-. Keyboard shortcut is Alt + -\nComment: Text written in a script that is not treated as code to be run, but rather as text that describes what the code is doing. These are usually short notes, beginning with a #\nComprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): A public repository of R packages.\nData frame: A two-dimensional data structure for storing tabular data in memory. Rows represent records and columns represent variables.\nFunction: A code block which gathers a sequence of operations into a whole, preserving it for ongoing use by defining a set of tasks that takes zero or more required and optional arguments as inputs and returns expected outputs (return values), if any. Functions enable repeating these defined tasks with one command, known as a function call.\nNA: A special value used to represent data that is not available.\nPipe operator: The %&gt;% used to make the output of one function the input of the next.\nPackage: A collection of code, data, and documentation that can be distributed and re-used. Also referred to in some languages as a library or module.\nParameter: A variable specified in a function definition whose value is passed to the function when the function is called. Parameters and arguments are distinct, but related concepts. Parameters are variables and arguments are the values assigned to those variables. In practice though these terms are often used interchangeably.\nPositional argument: An argument to a function that gets its value according to its place in the function’s definition, as opposed to a named argument that is explicitly matched by name.\nReproducible research: The practice of describing and documenting research results in such a way that another researcher or person can re-run the analysis code on the same data to obtain the same result.\nTibble: A modern replacement for R’s data frame, which stores tabular data in columns and rows, defined and used in the tidyverse. Almost always when you are working with a data frame, you are actually working with a tibble.\nTidy data: Tabular data that satisfies three conditions that facilitate initial cleaning, and later exploration and analysis—(1) each variable forms a column, (2) each observation forms a row, and (3) each type of observation unit forms a table.\nTidyverse: A collection of R packages for operating on tabular data in consistent ways.\nVariable: A name in a program that has some data associated with it. A variable’s value can be changed after definition.\nVector: A sequence of values that have all the same type. Vectors are the fundamental data structure in R; a scalar is just a vector with exactly one element."

The difference is that when you use an aesthetic as a parameter, you specify a specific value, such as color = \"blue\", rather than a mapping, such as aes(color = arm). Notice the difference: Inside the aes() function, we don’t actually specify the specific color values, ggplot does that for us. We only say that we want the data values of the arm column to correspond to different colors. (We will learn later how to tell ggplot to use specific colors in this mapping.)\nTry this with the boxplot example from the previous section. Map arm onto the fill aesthetic but set the color of the lines to \"navyblue\".\n\nggplot(clinical_measurements, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +\n  ___()\n\nNow do the reverse.

Both are separate downloads and installations, and you will need to install R first, followed by RStudio. Once both are installed, you would just open and work in RStudio, which will run R in the background. Then you will install some R packages (collections of functions you can use in your own coding) which we are using for this workshop.

    "text": "Spatial Logical Toy Inventor: Erno Rubik Assignee: Politoys Ipari Szovetkezet, Budapest, Hungary The first patent by the inventor is registered in Hungary. Appl. No.: 289,192 Filed: Aug. 3, 1981 Background of the Invention The invention relates to a spatial logical toy having a total of eighteen toy elements which form a regular or an irregular spatial body, preferably an oblong body, in the assembled state. Spatial logical toys are well known, such as that described in the HU-PS No. 170 062 of the same applicant, which relates to a spatial logical toy consisting of twenty-seven solids which form a cube in the assembled state. The toy elements, in the shape of small cubes, may be turned along the spatial axes of the cube by means of connecting elements arranged in the geometric center of the large cube. The surfaces of the small cubes forming each surface of the large cube are colored or carry numbers, figures or any other symbols which can be assembled into the predetermined logical order of sequence by simultaneously rotating the nine toy elements forming the surfaces of the large cube. Summary of the Invention The logical toy according to the present invention represents an improved form of the previously described spatial logical toy. The construction is based on the same principles, however, the internal connection is performed by means of absolutely new and particular solids. The key feature according to the invention, i.e. shape, name, sounds, mode of interconnection and central fixture will be described in detail by means of two preferred embodiments, by the aid of the accompanying drawings, wherein. Component blocks of the spatial logial toy. ex-2-figs.png What is claimed is: 1. In a spatial logical toy assembled from a plurality of toy elements, of which a predetermined number may be rotated in the direction of the spatial axes starting from the geometrical center of the logical toy, the improvement wherein the spatial logical toy is formed by a total of eighteen toy elements. Two sets of eight toy elements each comprise substantially cubiforms with integally formed cam elements and each of the sets comprise eight identical toy elements, and two connecting toy elements, and means for joining the connecting toy elements to coact with the cam elements to form an integrated toy body, the joining means comprising a single screw enclosed by a spring. The spatial logical toy as claimed in claim 1, wherein the toy has the shape of a regular geometrical body in the assembled state. The toy elements thereof belonging to one set comprise eight cubiform homologous elements each having a first cam element connected to one corner thereof. Two confining surfaces of which lie at a unit distance from two surfaces of the cube and are parallel therewith and are cut-off in the form of an ellipsis-quarter, and a third confining surface thereof is coplanar with another surface of the cube and between the two confining faces of the first cam element running parallel with the cube and the cube there is a hollow with a convex spherical surface."
