While R is the underlying statistical computing environment, RStudio is the graphical IDE (integrated development environment) that makes using R easier, more intuitive, and interactive. Both are separate downloads and installations, and you will need to install R first, followed by RStudio. Once both are installed, you would just open and work in RStudio, which will run R in the background. Then you will install some R packages (collections of functions you can use in your own coding) which we are using for this workshop. Please install R version 4.3.1 or later and RStudio version 2023.09.0 or later."

    "text": "Spatial Logical Toy Inventor: Erno Rubik Assignee: Politoys Ipari Szovetkezet, Budapest, Hungary The first patent by the inventor is registered in Hungary. Appl. No.: 289,192 Filed: Aug. 3, 1981 Background of the Invention The invention relates to a spatial logical toy having a total of eighteen toy elements which form a regular or an irregular spatial body, preferably an oblong body, in the assembled state. Spatial logical toys are well known, such as that described in the HU-PS No. 170 062 of the same applicant, which relates to a spatial logical toy consisting of twenty-seven solids which form a cube in the assembled state. The toy elements, in the shape of small cubes, may be turned along the spatial axes of the cube by means of connecting elements arranged in the geometric center of the large cube. The surfaces of the small cubes forming each surface of the large cube are colored or carry numbers, figures or any other symbols which can be assembled into the predetermined logical order of sequence by simultaneously rotating the nine toy elements forming the surfaces of the large cube. Summary of the Invention The logical toy according to the present invention represents an improved form of the previously described spatial logical toy. The construction is based on the same principles, however, the internal connection is performed by means of absolutely new and particular solids. The key feature according to the invention, i.e. shape, name, sounds, mode of interconnection and central fixture will be described in detail by means of two preferred embodiments, by the aid of the accompanying drawings, wherein. Component blocks of the spatial logial toy. ex-2-figs.png What is claimed is: 1. In a spatial logical toy assembled from a plurality of toy elements, of which a predetermined number may be rotated in the direction of the spatial axes starting from the geometrical center of the logical toy, the improvement wherein the spatial logical toy is formed by a total of eighteen toy elements. Two sets of eight toy elements each comprise substantially cubiforms with integally formed cam elements and each of the sets comprise eight identical toy elements, and two connecting toy elements, and means for joining the connecting toy elements to coact with the cam elements to form an integrated toy body, the joining means comprising a single screw enclosed by a spring.

    "text": "Worksheet: Introduction to R and Quarto\n\n1. Operators and Functions in R\nIn order to get familiar with the R language, we shall start by using simple operators and functions that are intuitive to us in our everyday lives.\n\n1.1 Arithmetic operators\n\n+                addition\n-                subtraction\n*                multiplication\n/                division\n^ or **          power\n\nx %*% y          matrix multiplication c(5, 3) %*% c(2, 4) == 22\nx %% y           modulo (x mod y) 5 %% 2 == 1\nx %/% y          whole number division: 5 %/% 2 == 2\n\nNote that while the first half is self-explanatory, the second is more specific to programming and/or R.\nLet’s try a few examples in R. First, always have a code chunk at the top that loads the libraries you need:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nThen, copy the following code chunk into your quarto document.\n\n99 + 1 + -1\n\n64 / 4\n\n64 / (2+2)\n\n64 / 2 + 2\n\nNotice the difference in the last two commands and it’s effect on the output.\n\n\n1.2 Logical operators and functions\n\n&lt;                less than\n&lt;=               less than or equal to\n&gt;                greater than\n&gt;=               greater than or equal to\n==               equal\n!=               not equal\n!x               not x (negation)\nx | y            x OR y\nx & y            x AND y\nxor(x, y)        exclusive OR (either in x or y, but not in both)\nisTRUE(x)        truth test for x\n\nFew examples for you to copy in your quarto document or directly on the console,\n\n99 &lt; 1\n\n!(99 &lt; 1)\n\n64 == 8*8\n\n(3 &gt; 2) | (4 &gt; 5)\n\n\n\n1.3 Numeric functions\n\nabs(x)             absolute value\nsqrt(x)            square root\nceiling(x)         round up: ceiling(3.475) is 4\nfloor(x)           round down: floor(3.475) is 3\nround(x, digits=n) round: round(3.475, digits=2) is 3.48\ncos(x), sin(x), tan(x), acos(x), cosh(x), acosh(x) etc.\nlog(x)             natural logarithm\nlog(10, base = n)  base n logarithm\nlog2(x)            base 2 logarithm\nlog10(x)           base 10 logarithm\nexp(x)             exponential function: e^x\n\nFew examples for you to copy in your quarto document or directly on the console,\n\nabs(99)\n\nabs(-99)\n\nsqrt(64)\n\nfloor(6.789)\n\n\n\n1.4 Statistical functions\nBelow is a list of statistical functions. These functions can have the argument na.rm, which is set to FALSE by default. This will let you deal with missing values (na = not available). If set to false, these are not removed (rm = remove).\n\nmean(x, na.rm = FALSE)  mean\nsd(x)                   standard deviation\nvar(x)                  variance\n\nmedian(x)               median\nquantile(x, probs)      quantile of x.  probs: vector of probabilities\n\nsum(x)                  sum\nmin(x)                  minimal value of x (x_min)\nmax(x)                  xaximal value of x (x_max)\nrange(x)                x_min und x_max\n\n# if center  = TRUE: subtract mean\n# if scale   = TRUE: divide by sd\nscale(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)   center and standardize\n\n# weighted sampling with argument prob:\nsample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob)  sampling with or without replacement. prob: vector of weights\n\n\n\n1.5 Other useful functions\n\nc()                    combine: used to create a vector\nseq(from, to, by)      generates a sequence\n:                      colon operator: generates a 'regular' sequence in increments of 1\nrep(x, times, each)    repeats x\n                          times: sequence is repeated n times\n                          each: each element is repeated n times\n\nhead(x, n = 6)         first 6 elements of x\ntail(x, n = 6)         last 6 elements of x\n\nFew examples for you to copy in your quarto document or directly on the console,\n\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\nmean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))\n\nmean(c(1, NA, 3, 4, 5, 6), na.rm = TRUE)\n\nmean(c(1, NA, 3, 4, 5, 6), na.rm = FALSE)\n\nsum(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))\n\nseq(from = 1, to = 6, by = 1)\n\nseq(from = 1, to = 6, by = 2)\n\nrep(1:6, times = 2, each = 2)\n\nReady to put these new skills to use? Here’s an exercise.\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nWrite R commands to calculate the following:\n\nThe sum of your birth day, month and year\n250 divided by the product of 4 and 5\nHalf of the sum of 37.5, 51.3, and 101.7\n\\(\\frac{1}{3} * { (1+3+5+7+2) \\over (3+5+4)}\\)\n\\(\\sqrt[3]{8}\\)\n\\(\\sin\\pi\\), \\(\\cos\\pi\\), \\(\\tan\\pi\\)\nCalculate the 10-based logarithm of 100, and multiply the result with the cosine of pi. Hint: see ?log and ?pi.\nCalculate the mean, sd and range of the vector [1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 16]\nGenerate the following output: 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 7\nGenerate the following output: 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\n\n\nChallenge Exercise 1\nWrite R commands to evaluate the following:\n\nYou have 83 chocolates in a bag. You would like to divide them into smaller bags of 8.\n1.1 How many small bags will you need?\n1.2 After the bags are filled, how many extra chocolates will you have remaining?\nYou are planning a research study with the following eligibility criteria:\n\n\nStudy participant should be between 18-25 years old (variable: age)\n\nHemoglobin should be over 10 (variable: hgb)\n\nStudy participant should not weigh over 50 (variable: wgt)\n\nStudy location should be X or Y (variable: loc)\n\n\nI have the following observations from a clinical parameter – x &lt;- c(23.1924, 21.4545, 24.6778) However, I would prefer to limit the values to 1 decimal point. How would you do that?\nLook up the rnorm() function in the Help Viewer. What arguments does this function take? Any default values?\nTry to nest a function within another\n\nAssuming you get all the information in forms of the above variables, write an R command to determine eligibility.\n\n\n2. Objects and Vectors in R\n\n2.1 Objects / Variables\nSo far, we have been happy to run functions and read the results on the screen. What if you’d like to read results later? You will need to save them by creating Objects.\nCopy the following code chunk into your quarto document\n\nnumber1 &lt;- 9\nsqrt(number1)\n\n[1] 3\n\nnumber2 &lt;- 10\n\nnumber1 * number2\n\n[1] 90\n\n\nWhat do you think happens when you use the same object name to another value? Try it!\n\nnewnumber &lt;- 100\nnewnumber &lt;- 150\n\n#What does R pick?\nnewnumber\n\nObject/Variable names\nYou can choose almost any name you like for an object, as long as the name does not begin with a number or a special character like +, -, *, /, ^, !, @, or &.\n\n# good variable names\nx_mean\nx_sd\n\nnum_people\nage\n\n# not so good\np\na\n\n# bad variable names\nx mean\nsd of x\n\n\n\n2.2 Vectors\nVectors are the fundamental data type in R - all other data types are composed of vectors. These can subdivided into:\nnumeric vectors: a further subdivision is into integer (whole numbers) and double (floating point numbers).\ncharacter vectors: these consist of characters strings and are surrounded by quotes, either single ' or double \", e.g. 'word' or \"word\".\nlogical vectors: these can take three values: TRUE, FALSE or NA.\nVectors consist of elements of the same type, i.e., we cannot combine logical and character elements in a vector. Vectors have three properties:\nType: typeof(): what is it? Length: length(): how many elements? Attribute: attributes(): additional metadata\nVectors are created using the c() function or by using special function, such as seq() or rep().\n\n# Numeric vectors\nnum_vec &lt;- c(2.1,2.2,2.3,2.4,2.5)\nlength(num_vec)\n\n[1] 5\n\n# Character vectors\nchar_vec &lt;- c(\"hello\",\"hi\")\nlength(char_vec)\n\n[1] 2\n\n# Logical vectors\nlog_vec &lt;- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)\ntypeof(log_vec)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nSome fun with vectors\n\nnum_vec[1] # what's the first element of num_vec?\n\nnum_vec[4] # 4th?\n\nnum_vec[-1] # what does -1 do?\n\nnum_vec[1:3]\n\nnum_vec[-c(1, 3)]\n\nTry this on your own with the character vectors. What differences and similarities do you notice?\nExercise time!\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of a numeric vector of the first 6 multiples of 5.\nWhat happens if you attempt at arithmetic function on a numeric vector? (Example: num_vec + 1)\nWhat happens if you attempt the same on a character vector?\nExplore the str_length() function on a character vector.\nWhat happens if you try to make a vector consisting of different data types?\nMetadata hygiene: Give examples of good and bad ways to make variable names for the following columns in the Metadata spreadsheet –\n\nParticipant ID\nDate of Sample Collection\nType of Sample\nMean of past 3 weights\nNumber of people\n\n\n\n\nChallenge Exercise 2\n\nCalculate the mean of the sum of the first 6 even numbers - using one R command.\nfirst_name and last_name are two separate variables. Make one variable with both together, calling it full_name. Hint: it is a function\n\n\n\n3. Dataframes in R\nFor data analysis and statistics, data frames are important objects of data representation. A data frame is a two dimensional structure with rows and columns, like a table. You can think of it as a collection of vectors. Let us try making one.\n\n# creating a vector with an ID \nid &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\n\n# creating another vector with names\nname &lt;- c(\"PersonA\", \"PersonB\", \"PersonC\")\n\n# creating another vector with year of birth \nyear_of_birth &lt;- c(1990, 1995, 2000)\n\n# creating another vector with favourite colour\nfav_colour &lt;- c(\"red\", \"green\", \"yellow\")\n\n#Make a dataframe from the above\n# note, make sure you've added the tidyverse library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndf &lt;- tibble(id, name, year_of_birth, fav_colour)\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n     id name    year_of_birth fav_colour\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1     1 PersonA          1990 red       \n2     2 PersonB          1995 green     \n3     3 PersonC          2000 yellow    \n\n\nYou just made a dataframe!\nNow, normally you will be importing one and using it to get useful information. You can extract useful information like number of rows, columns, details of each, summary of values, etc\nHere are a few helpful functions -\n\nattributes(df)\n\n$class\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n$row.names\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n$names\n[1] \"id\"            \"name\"          \"year_of_birth\" \"fav_colour\"   \n\nrownames(df)\n\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\"\n\ncolnames(df)\n\n[1] \"id\"            \"name\"          \"year_of_birth\" \"fav_colour\"   \n\n# We didn't assign any yet! Let us try to assign column names\ncolnames(df) &lt;- c(\"ID\",\"name\",\"year_of_birth\",\"favourite_colour\")\ncolnames(df)\n\n[1] \"ID\"               \"name\"             \"year_of_birth\"    \"favourite_colour\"\n\n## Note: When importing an existing data file, depending on your it's structure, you can ask R to import with or without row and column names)\n\nnrow(df)\n\n[1] 3\n\nncol(df)\n\n[1] 4\n\n# Data frame subsetting (I want only a few columns of my interest)\nselect(df, name)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 1\n  name   \n  &lt;chr&gt;  \n1 PersonA\n2 PersonB\n3 PersonC\n\nselect(df, year_of_birth)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 1\n  year_of_birth\n          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          1990\n2          1995\n3          2000\n\n#extract row 2 only\nslice(df, 2)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n     ID name    year_of_birth favourite_colour\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     2 PersonB          1995 green           \n\n#extract rows 1, and 3\nslice(df, c(1,3))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n     ID name    year_of_birth favourite_colour\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 PersonA          1990 red             \n2     3 PersonC          2000 yellow          \n\n#extract column 3 only\nselect(df, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 1\n  year_of_birth\n          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          1990\n2          1995\n3          2000\n\n#extract rows based on one condition\nfilter(df, year_of_birth &gt; 1995)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n     ID name    year_of_birth favourite_colour\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     3 PersonC          2000 yellow          \n\n#extract rows based on multiple conditions\nfilter(df, year_of_birth &gt; 1995 & favourite_colour==\"red\")\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 4\n# ℹ 4 variables: ID &lt;dbl&gt;, name &lt;chr&gt;, year_of_birth &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   favourite_colour &lt;chr&gt;\n\nfilter(df, year_of_birth &gt; 1995 | favourite_colour==\"red\")\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n     ID name    year_of_birth favourite_colour\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 PersonA          1990 red             \n2     3 PersonC          2000 yellow          \n\n#Note the difference in output upon use of different logical operators AND and OR\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\nMake an expression to get only rows when the name is Person C or the favorite color is green.\nMake a new dataframe with 6 rows and 5 columns (get creative!)\nAdd different combinations of data to be able to use the above functions and compare output.\nTry above functions on your new dataframe and note any interesting observations.\nTry some other functions: str(), head(), view().\n\n\n\nChallenge Exercise 3\n\nCan you think of other simple questions you may need to query your dataset?\nTry to look your query up on google and see if you can find a function that addresses your need! (add ‘in R’ at the end for relevant answers!)\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully reached the end of this exercise. You now possess the most important skill: google your query!"

Add a new column browsing by language that is the ratio of number of browser tabs currently open and number of languages spoken:\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n\nCounting with custom conditions\nIt is quite common that we want to count items that meet a specific condition. For example, let’s say we want to count how many people are taller than 155 cm. To do this efficiently, we first create a new column that indicates whether the condition is met or not, and we then use count with that indicator column.\nThe easiest way to create indicator columns is via the function if_else(), which takes three arguments: a condition, a result if the condition is met, and a result if the condition is not met. The following example shows how to create an indicator column showing whether a variable is positive or negative:\n\ndata &lt;- tibble(x = c(-0.5, 2.3, 50, -1.4))\ndata\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 1\n      x\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  -0.5\n2   2.3\n3  50  \n4  -1.4\n\n\n\ndata %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    sign_of_x = if_else(x &gt;= 0, \"positive\", \"negative\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  count(sign_of_x)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sign_of_x     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 negative      2\n2 positive      2\n\n\nNow try this yourself. Count how many people are taller than 155 cm. Then sort your results.\nHere are a few additional exercises that you can work on to practice and learn more about survey responses from everyone in this room!\n\n\nExercise\nWrite R commands for the following -\n1. How many people took this survey?\n2. How many questions did we ask?\n3. What questions did we ask?\n4. Give a few examples of the data types captured in the questions\n5. Look at responses of questions 4-6 from all participants\n6. Try to rename a column (question)\n7. Make a new dataframe of 5 questions of your choice.\n8. Can you get the height of the tallest person in this room?\n9. How many people speak more than 2 languages?\n10. Select the question about R experience and sort by the kind of R background and experience in this room.\n12. What is the ratio of people who took a plane to this workshop vs those who walked?"

Much of the data we work with, however, do not have a natural form and we need to make decisions about how they are to be represented. Try different ways to visualize the datasets so meaningful patterns may be found.\n\n\nGenetic profiles of cancer\nThese datasets contains 10 cancer samples. Table 1 describes the mutational status for a set of genes (A-E) and whether a mutation if absent (0) or present (1). Table 2 summarizes the expression levels of those genes, ranging from no expression (0) to high expression (3).\n\n\nTable 1: Mutational status for a set of genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsample -&gt;\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\n\nGene A\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nGene B\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nGene C\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nGene D\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nGene E\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Expression levels for a set of genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsample -&gt;\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\n\nGene A\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n\n\nGene B\n1\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n\n\nGene C\n1\n1\n3\n1\n2\n2\n3\n0\n3\n0\n\n\nGene D\n0\n0\n2\n1\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nGene E\n1\n3\n3\n1\n3\n1\n2\n1\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          1.

Download the dataset here.\nIn this worksheet, we will discuss a core concept of ggplot, the mapping of data values onto aesthetics.\nWe will be using the R package tidyverse, which includes ggplot() and related functions.\nCopy the following code chunk into your quarto document.

Map the column ph onto the x axis and the column crp_blood onto the y axis, and use geom_line() to display the data.\nWhenever you see ___ in the code below, that means you should swap it in with your own code.\n\nggplot(clinical_measurements, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +\n  ___()\n\nTry again.

For example, geom_boxplot() will make boxplots. For boxplots, we frequently want categorical data on the x or y axis. For example, we might want a separate boxplot for each month. Try this out. Put nugent_score on the x axis, ph on the y axis, and use geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(clinical_measurements, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +\n  ___()\n\nNow try swapping the x and y axis geom_jitter()\n\nggplot(clinical_measurements, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +\n  ___()\n\nNow try swapping the x and y axis\n\nggplot(clinical_measurements, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +\n  ___()\n\n\n\nAdding color\nTry again with geom_jitter(), this time using ph as the location along the y axis and arm for the color. Remember to check the ggplot cheat sheet, or type ?geom_jitter() in the console to and look at the “Aesthetics” section if you get stuck.\n\nggplot(clinical_measurements, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +\n  ___()\n\n(Hint: Try adding size = 3 as a parameter to the geom_jitter() to create larger points.)\n\n\nUsing aesthetics as parameters\nMany of the aesthetics (such as color, fill, and also size to change line size or point thickness) can be used as parameters inside a geom rather than inside an aes() statement. The difference is that when you use an aesthetic as a parameter, you specify a specific value, such as color = \"blue\", rather than a mapping, such as aes(color = arm). Notice the difference: Inside the aes() function, we don’t actually specify the specific color values, ggplot does that for us. We only say that we want the data values of the arm column to correspond to different colors. (We will learn later how to tell ggplot to use specific colors in this mapping.)\nTry this with the boxplot example from the previous section. Map arm onto the fill aesthetic but set the color of the lines to \"navyblue\".\n\nggplot(clinical_measurements, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +\n  ___()\n\nNow do the reverse.

The scale functions are always named scale_color_*() or scale_fill_*(), depending on whether they apply to the color or fill aesthetic. The * indicates some other words specifying the type of the scale, for example scale_color_brewer() or scale_color_distiller() for discrete or continuous scales from the ColorBrewer project, respectively. You can find all available built-in scales here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-scales\nNow consider the following plot.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to change the color scale to one from the ColorBrewer project, which scale function would you have to add? scale_color_brewer(), scale_color_distiller(), scale_fill_brewer(), scale_fill_distiller()?\n\n # answer the question above to yourself\n\n #solution: \n scale_fill_distiller()\n\nNow try this out.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  ___\n\n\n # solution\n  ggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_distiller()\n\n\n\n\nMost color scale functions have additional customizations. How to use them depends on the specific scale function. For the ColorBrewer scales you can set direction = 1 or direction = -1 to set the direction of the scale (light to dark or dark to light). You can also set the palette via a numeric argument, e.g. palette = 1, palette = 2, palette = 3 etc.\nTry this out by setting the direction of the scale from light to dark and using palette #4.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n# solution \nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(direction = 1, palette = 4)\n\n\n\n\nA popular set of scales are the viridis scales, which are provided by scale_*_viridis_c() for continuous data and scale_*_viridis_d() for discrete data. Change the above plot to use a viridis scale.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n  # solution \n    ggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\nThe viridis scales can be customized with direction (as before), option (which can be \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"E\"), and begin and end which are numerical values between 0 and 1 indicating where in the color scale the data should begin or end. For example, begin = 0.2 means that the lowest data value is mapped to the 20th percentile in the scale.\nTry different choices for option, begin, and end to see how they change the plot.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n  # solution\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"B\", begin = 0.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing scale title and labels\nIn a previous worksheet, we used arguments such as name, breaks, labels, and limits to customize the axis. For color scales, instead of an axis we have a legend, and we can use the same arguments inside the scale function to customize how the legend looks.\nTry this out. Set the scale limits from 10 to 110 and set the name of the scale and the breaks as you wish.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = ___,\n    breaks = ___,\n    limits = ___\n  )\n\n\n# solution\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"temperature (F)\",\n    breaks = c(25, 50, 75, 100),\n    limits = c(10, 110)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nNote: Color scales ignore the expand argument, so you cannot use it to expand the scale beyond the data values as you can for position scales.\n\n\nBinned scales\nResearch into human perception has shown that continuous coloring can be difficult to interpret. Therefore, it is often preferable to use a small number of discrete colors to indicate ranges of data values. You can do this in ggplot with binned scales. For example, scale_fill_viridis_b() provides a binned version of the viridis scale. Try this out.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  ___\n\n\n# solution\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_b()\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the number of bins by providing the n.breaks argument or alternatively by setting breaks explicitly. Try this out.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n \n  # solution\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_b(\n    n.breaks = 7\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScales from the colorspace package\nThe color scales provided by the colorspace package follow a simple naming scheme of the form scale_&lt;aesthetic&gt;_&lt;datatype&gt;_&lt;colorscale&gt;(), where &lt;aesthetic&gt; is the name of the aesthetic (fill, color, colour), &lt;datatype&gt; indicates the type of variable plotted (discrete, continuous, binned), and colorscale stands for the type of the color scale (qualitative, sequential, diverging, divergingx).\nFor the mean temperature plot we have been using throughout this worksheet, which 2 color scales from the colorspace package is/are appropriate?\nscale_fill_binned_sequential(), scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(), scale_fill_continuous_sequential(), scale_color_continuous_sequential(), scale_color_continuous_diverging()&gt;\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  ___\n\n\n # solution\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_continuous_sequential()\n\n\n\n\nYou can customize the colorspace scales with the palette argument, which takes the name of a palette (e.g., \"Inferno\", \"BluYl\", \"Lajolla\"). Try this out. Also try reversing the scale direction with rev = TRUE or rev = FALSE. (The colorspace scales use rev instead of direction.) You can find the names of all supported scales here (consider specifically single-hue and multi-hue sequential palettes).\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n  # solution\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_continuous_sequential(\n    palette = \"Lajolla\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use begin and end just like in the viridis scales.\n\n\nManual scales\nFor discrete data with a small number of categories, it’s usually best to set colors manually. This can be done with the scale functions scale_*_manual(). These functions take an argument values that specifies the color values to use.\nTo see how this works, let’s go back to this plot of temperatures over time for four locations.\n\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use the following four colors: \"gold2\", \"firebrick\", \"blue3\", \"springgreen4\". We can visualize this palette using the function swatchplot() from the colorspace package.\n\ncolorspace::swatchplot(c(\"gold2\", \"firebrick\", \"blue3\", \"springgreen4\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow apply this color palette to the temperatures plot, by using the manual color scale. Hint: use the values argument to provide the colors to the manual scale.\n\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  ___\n\n\n# solution\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"gold2\", \"firebrick\", \"blue3\", \"springgreen4\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nOne problem with this approach is that we can’t easily control which data value gets assigned to which color. What if we wanted San Diego to be shown in green and Chicago in blue? The simplest way to resolve this issue is to use a named vector. A named vector in R is a vector where each value has a name. Named vectors are created by writing c(name1 = value1, name2 = value2, ...). See the following example.\n\n# regular vector\nc(\"cat\", \"mouse\", \"house\")\n\n[1] \"cat\"   \"mouse\" \"house\"\n\n# named vector\nc(A = \"cat\", B = \"mouse\", C = \"house\")\n\n      A       B       C \n  \"cat\" \"mouse\" \"house\" \n\n\nThe names in the second example are A, B, and C. Notice that the names are not in quotes. However, if you need a name containing a space (such as Death Valley), you need to enclose the name in backticks. Thus, our named vector of colors could be written like so:\n\nc(`Death Valley` = \"gold2\", Houston = \"firebrick\", Chicago = \"blue3\", `San Diego` = \"springgreen4\")\n\n  Death Valley        Houston        Chicago      San Diego \n       \"gold2\"    \"firebrick\"        \"blue3\" \"springgreen4\" \n\n\nNow try to use this color vector in the figure showing temperatures over time.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n # solution\n\n ggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      `Death Valley` = \"gold2\",\n      Houston = \"firebrick\",\n      Chicago = \"blue3\",\n      `San Diego` = \"springgreen4\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nTry some other colors also. For example, you could use the Okabe-Ito colors:\n\n# Okabe-Ito colors\ncolorspace::swatchplot(c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\", \"#000000\"))\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can find a list of all named colors here. You can also run the command colors() in your R console to get a list of all available color names.\nHint: It’s a good idea to never use the colors \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"cyan\", \"magenta\", \"yellow\". They are extreme points in the RGB color space and tend to look unnatural and too crazy. Try this by making a swatch plot of these colors, and compare for example to the color scale containing the colors \"firebrick\", \"springgreen4\", \"blue3\", \"turquoise3\", \"darkorchid2\", \"gold2\". Do you see the difference?\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nSolution to the challenge to make the summary table of mean temperature by month:\n\n# paste this below the \"temperatures\" code-chunk\ntemps_months &lt;- read_csv(\"https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/datasets/tempnormals.csv\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(location, month_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean = mean(temperature)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    month = factor(\n      month_name,\n      levels = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\")\n    ),\n    location = factor(\n      location, levels = c(\"Death Valley\", \"Houston\", \"San Diego\", \"Chicago\")\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-month_name)"

The plots are stored in variables p1, p2, p3, p4.\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))\np1  \n\n\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))\np2\n\n\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_smooth(aes(disp, qsec))\np3\n\n\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_bar(aes(carb))\np4\n\n\n\n\nTo show plots side-by-side, we use the operator |, as in p1 | p2. Try this by making a compound plot of plots p1, p2, p3 side-by-side.\n\n # build all the code for this exercisew\n\n  # solution \n p1 | p2 | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo show plots on top of one-another, we use the operator /, as in p1 / p2. Try this by making a compound plot of plots p1, p2, p3 on top of each other.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n  p1 / p2 / p3\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use parentheses to group plots with respect to the operators | and /. For example, we can place several plots side-by-side and then place this entire row of plots on top of another plot. Try putting p1, p2, p3, on the top row, and p4 on the bottom row.\n\n(___) / ___\n\n\n# solution\n(p1 | p2 | p3 ) / p4\n\n\n\nPlot annotations\nThe patchwork package provides a powerful annotation system via the plot_annotation() function that can be added to a plot assembly. For example, we can add plot tags (the labels in the upper left corner identifying the plots) via the plot annotation tag_levels. You can set tag_levels = \"A\" to generate tags A, B, C, etc. Try this out.\n\n(p1 | p2 | p3 ) / p4\n\n\n\n\n\n# solution\n(p1 | p2 | p3 ) / p4 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    tag_levels = \"A\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nTry also tag levels such as \"a\", \"i\", or \"1\".\nYou can also add elements such as titles, subtitles, and captions, by setting the title, subtitle, or caption argument in plot_annotation(). Try this out by adding an overall title to the figure from the previous exercise.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n # solution\n(p1 | p2 | p3 ) / p4 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    tag_levels = \"A\",\n    title = \"Various observations about old cars\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAlso set a subtitle and a caption.\nFinally, you can change the theme of all plots in the plot assembly via the & operator, as in (p1 | p2) & theme_bw(). Try this out.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n# solution\n(p1 | p2) & theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you write this expression without parentheses? Do you understand why?\n(Big) Challenge Problem:\nIf you have time this morning, or if you want to work on it this afternoon, try analyzing a new dataset to test your R skills. First, learn what the columns mean, what missing values you see, and then start to ask questions about patterns in the data by making plots.\nYou can browse the datasets at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data (click on a year folder and go to the README to read about the datasets). Or pick from one of the ones below:\n\n# fish consumption in different countries \nconsumption &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-10-12/fish-and-seafood-consumption-per-capita.csv')\n\n# world cup Cricket matches from 1996 to 2005\nmatches &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-11-30/matches.csv')\n\n# malaria deaths by age across the world and time. \n malaria_deaths&lt;- readr::read_csv('https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-11-13/malaria_deaths_age.csv')\n\n#meteorites and/or volcanos:\n# note to plot a map, try the following:\ncountries_map &lt;- ggplot2::map_data(\"world\")\nworld_map&lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_map(data = countries_map, \n           map = countries_map,aes(x = long, y = lat, map_id = region, group = group),\n           fill = \"white\", color = \"black\", size = 0.1) # then add geom_point() to this map to add lat/long points\n\nmeteorites &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-11/meteorites.csv\")\nvolcano &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/volcano.csv\")\n\n# or pick any dataset from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data , \n# just click on a year folder and go to the README to read about the datasets\n# if you have trouble loading a dataset there, ask for help!"

Verify that adding this theme to the plot makes no difference in the output. Then change the overall font size by providing the theme function with a numeric font size argument, e.g. theme_gray(16).\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  ___\n\n\n# solution\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_gray(16)\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 package has many built-in themes, including theme_minimal(), theme_bw(), theme_void(), theme_dark(). Try these different themes on the above plot. Also try again changing the font size. You can see all themes provided by ggplot2 here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n #| eval: TRUE\n#| echo: TRUE\n\n # solution\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw(12)\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_minimal(14)\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_void()\n\nMany other packages also provide themes. For example, the cowplot package provides themes theme_half_open(), theme_minimal_grid(), theme_minimal_hgrid(), and theme_minimal_vgrid(). You can see all cowplot themes here: https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/themes.html\n\n #| eval: TRUE\n#| echo: TRUE\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n  # solution\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_half_open()\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_minimal_grid()\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_minimal_hgrid()\n\nCompare the visual appearance of theme_minimal() from ggplot2 to theme_minimal_grid() from cowplot. What similarities and differences to you notice? Which do you prefer? (There is no correct answer here, just be aware of the differences and of your preferences.)\n\n #| eval: TRUE\n#| echo: TRUE\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n  # solution\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_minimal_grid()\n\n\n\nModifying theme elements\nYou can modify theme elements by adding a theme() call to the plot. Inside the theme() call you specify which theme element you want to modify (e.g., axis.title, axis.text.x, panel.background, etc) and what changes you want to make. For example, to make axis titles blue, you would write:\n\ntheme(\n  axis.title = element_text(color = \"blue\")\n)\n\nThere are many theme settings, and for each one you need to know what type of an element it is (element_text(), element_line(), element_rect() for text, lines, or rectangles, respectively). A complete description of the available options is available at the ggplot2 website: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html\nHere, we will only try a few simple things. For example, see if you can make the legend title blue and the legend text red.\n\n# make the legend title blue and the legend text red\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nNow color the area behind the legend in \"aliceblue\". Hint: The theme element you need to change is called legend.background. There is also an element legend.box.background but it is only visible if legend.background is not shown, and in the default ggplot2 themes that is not the case.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n # solution\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme(\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"aliceblue\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAnother commonly used feature in themes are margins. Many parts of the plot theme can understand customized margins, which control how much spacing there is between different parts of a plot. Margins are typically specified with the function margin(), which takes four numbers specifying the margins in points, in the order top, right, bottom, left. So, margin(10, 5, 5, 10) would specify a top margin of 10pt, a right margin of 5pt, a bottom margin of 5pt, and a left margin of 10pt.\nTry this out by setting the legend margin (element legend.margin) such that there is no top and no bottom margin but 10pt left and right margin.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n # solution \nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme(\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"aliceblue\"),\n    legend.margin = margin(0, 10, 0, 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThere are many other things you can do. Try at least some of the following:\n\nChange the horizontal or vertical justification of text with hjust and vjust.\nChange the font family with family.1\nChange the panel grid. For example, create only horizontal lines, or only vertical lines.\nChange the overall margin of the plot with plot.margin.\nMove the position of the legend with legend.position and legend.justification.\nTurn off some elements by setting them to element_blank().\n\n1 Getting fonts to work well can be tricky in R. Which specific fonts work depends on the graphics device and the operating system. You can try some of the following fonts and see if they work on app.terra.bio: \"Palatino\", \"Times\", \"Helvetica\", \"Courier\", \"ITC Bookman\", \"ITC Avant Garde Gothic\", \"ITC Zapf Chancery\".\n\n\nWriting your own theme\nYou can write a theme by\n\ntheme_colorful &lt;-\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(color = \"mediumblue\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"springgreen4\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(color = \"firebrick4\")\n  )\n\nHint: Do you have to add theme_colorful or theme_colorful()? Do you understand which option is correct and why? If you are unsure, try both and see what happens.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n # solution\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_colorful\n\n\n\n\nNow write your own theme and then add it to the penguing plot.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n # solution\n\nmytheme &lt;- theme_minimal_grid() +\n  theme(\n    panel.border = element_rect(size = 1, color = \"black\"),\n    legend.box.background = element_rect(size = 0.5, color = \"black\")\n  )\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  mytheme"

This dataset contains the average temperature for each day of the year for four different locations.\n\ntemperatures\n\n# A tibble: 1,464 × 4\n   location     day_of_year month temperature\n   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Death Valley           1 01           51  \n 2 Death Valley           2 01           51.2\n 3 Death Valley           3 01           51.3\n 4 Death Valley           4 01           51.4\n 5 Death Valley           5 01           51.6\n 6 Death Valley           6 01           51.7\n 7 Death Valley           7 01           51.9\n 8 Death Valley           8 01           52  \n 9 Death Valley           9 01           52.2\n10 Death Valley          10 01           52.3\n# ℹ 1,454 more rows\n\n\nWe will also be working with an aggregated version of this dataset called temps_months, which contains the mean temperature for each month for the same locations.\n\ntemps_months\n\n# A tibble: 48 × 3\n# Groups:   location [4]\n   location  mean month\n   &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;\n 1 Chicago   50.4 Apr  \n 2 Chicago   74.1 Aug  \n 3 Chicago   29   Dec  \n 4 Chicago   28.9 Feb  \n 5 Chicago   24.8 Jan  \n 6 Chicago   75.8 Jul  \n 7 Chicago   71.0 Jun  \n 8 Chicago   38.8 Mar  \n 9 Chicago   60.9 May  \n10 Chicago   41.6 Nov  \n# ℹ 38 more rows\n\n\nAs a challenge, try to create this above table yourself using group_by() and summarize() like we learned about Wednesday., and then make a month column which is a factor with levels froing from “Jan” to “Dec”, and make the location column a factor with levels “Death Valley”, “Houston”, “San Diego”, “Chicago”. If you are having trouble, the solution is at the end of this page, make sure you copy it into your code so the rest of the exercise works.\n\n# check solution at the end before moving on!\ntemps_months &lt;- read_csv(\"https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/datasets/tempnormals.csv\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(___) %&gt;%\n  summarize(___) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    month = factor(\n      month_name,\n      ___\n    ),\n    location = factor(\n      location, ___\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-month_name)\n\n\nBuilt in ggplot2 color scales\nWe will start with built-in ggplot2 color scales, which require no additional packages. The scale functions are always named scale_color_*() or scale_fill_*(), depending on whether they apply to the color or fill aesthetic. The * indicates some other words specifying the type of the scale, for example scale_color_brewer() or scale_color_distiller() for discrete or continuous scales from the ColorBrewer project, respectively. You can find all available built-in scales here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-scales\nNow consider the following plot.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to change the color scale to one from the ColorBrewer project, which scale function would you have to add? scale_color_brewer(), scale_color_distiller(), scale_fill_brewer(), scale_fill_distiller()?\n\n # answer the question above to yourself\n\nNow try this out.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  ___\n\nMost color scale functions have additional customizations. How to use them depends on the specific scale function. For the ColorBrewer scales you can set direction = 1 or direction = -1 to set the direction of the scale (light to dark or dark to light). You can also set the palette via a numeric argument, e.g. palette = 1, palette = 2, palette = 3 etc.\nTry this out by setting the direction of the scale from light to dark and using palette #4.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nA popular set of scales are the viridis scales, which are provided by scale_*_viridis_c() for continuous data and scale_*_viridis_d() for discrete data. Change the above plot to use a viridis scale.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nThe viridis scales can be customized with direction (as before), option (which can be \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"E\"), and begin and end which are numerical values between 0 and 1 indicating where in the color scale the data should begin or end. For example, begin = 0.2 means that the lowest data value is mapped to the 20th percentile in the scale.\nTry different choices for option, begin, and end to see how they change the plot.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n\n\nCustomizing scale title and labels\nIn a previous worksheet, we used arguments such as name, breaks, labels, and limits to customize the axis. For color scales, instead of an axis we have a legend, and we can use the same arguments inside the scale function to customize how the legend looks.\nTry this out. Set the scale limits from 10 to 110 and set the name of the scale and the breaks as you wish.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = ___,\n    breaks = ___,\n    limits = ___\n  )\n\nNote: Color scales ignore the expand argument, so you cannot use it to expand the scale beyond the data values as you can for position scales.\n\n\nBinned scales\nResearch into human perception has shown that continuous coloring can be difficult to interpret. Therefore, it is often preferable to use a small number of discrete colors to indicate ranges of data values. You can do this in ggplot with binned scales. For example, scale_fill_viridis_b() provides a binned version of the viridis scale. Try this out.\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  ___\n\nYou can change the number of bins by providing the n.breaks argument or alternatively by setting breaks explicitly. Try this out.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n\n\nScales from the colorspace package\nThe color scales provided by the colorspace package follow a simple naming scheme of the form scale_&lt;aesthetic&gt;_&lt;datatype&gt;_&lt;colorscale&gt;(), where &lt;aesthetic&gt; is the name of the aesthetic (fill, color, colour), &lt;datatype&gt; indicates the type of variable plotted (discrete, continuous, binned), and colorscale stands for the type of the color scale (qualitative, sequential, diverging, divergingx).\nFor the mean temperature plot we have been using throughout this worksheet, which 2 color scales from the colorspace package is/are appropriate?\nscale_fill_binned_sequential(), scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(), scale_fill_continuous_sequential(), scale_color_continuous_sequential(), scale_color_continuous_diverging()&gt;\n\nggplot(temps_months, aes(x = month, y = location, fill = mean)) + \n  geom_tile() + \n  coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) +\n  ___\n\nYou can customize the colorspace scales with the palette argument, which takes the name of a palette (e.g., \"Inferno\", \"BluYl\", \"Lajolla\"). Try this out. Also try reversing the scale direction with rev = TRUE or rev = FALSE. (The colorspace scales use rev instead of direction.) You can find the names of all supported scales here (consider specifically single-hue and multi-hue sequential palettes).\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nYou can also use begin and end just like in the viridis scales.\n\n\nManual scales\nFor discrete data with a small number of categories, it’s usually best to set colors manually. This can be done with the scale functions scale_*_manual(). These functions take an argument values that specifies the color values to use.\nTo see how this works, let’s go back to this plot of temperatures over time for four locations.\n\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use the following four colors: \"gold2\", \"firebrick\", \"blue3\", \"springgreen4\". We can visualize this palette using the function swatchplot() from the colorspace package.\n\ncolorspace::swatchplot(c(\"gold2\", \"firebrick\", \"blue3\", \"springgreen4\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow apply this color palette to the temperatures plot, by using the manual color scale. Hint: use the values argument to provide the colors to the manual scale.\n\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  ___\n\nOne problem with this approach is that we can’t easily control which data value gets assigned to which color. What if we wanted San Diego to be shown in green and Chicago in blue? The simplest way to resolve this issue is to use a named vector. A named vector in R is a vector where each value has a name. Named vectors are created by writing c(name1 = value1, name2 = value2, ...). See the following example.\n\n# regular vector\nc(\"cat\", \"mouse\", \"house\")\n\n[1] \"cat\"   \"mouse\" \"house\"\n\n# named vector\nc(A = \"cat\", B = \"mouse\", C = \"house\")\n\n      A       B       C \n  \"cat\" \"mouse\" \"house\" \n\n\nThe names in the second example are A, B, and C. Notice that the names are not in quotes. However, if you need a name containing a space (such as Death Valley), you need to enclose the name in backticks. Thus, our named vector of colors could be written like so:\n\nc(`Death Valley` = \"gold2\", Houston = \"firebrick\", Chicago = \"blue3\", `San Diego` = \"springgreen4\")\n\n  Death Valley        Houston        Chicago      San Diego \n       \"gold2\"    \"firebrick\"        \"blue3\" \"springgreen4\" \n\n\nNow try to use this color vector in the figure showing temperatures over time.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nTry some other colors also. For example, you could use the Okabe-Ito colors:\n\n# Okabe-Ito colors\ncolorspace::swatchplot(c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\", \"#000000\"))\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can find a list of all named colors here. You can also run the command colors() in your R console to get a list of all available color names.\nHint: It’s a good idea to never use the colors \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"cyan\", \"magenta\", \"yellow\". They are extreme points in the RGB color space and tend to look unnatural and too crazy. Try this by making a swatch plot of these colors, and compare for example to the color scale containing the colors \"firebrick\", \"springgreen4\", \"blue3\", \"turquoise3\", \"darkorchid2\", \"gold2\". Do you see the difference?\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nSolution to the challenge to make the summary table of mean temperature by month:\n\n# paste this below the \"temperatures\" code-chunk\ntemps_months &lt;- read_csv(\"https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/datasets/tempnormals.csv\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(location, month_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean = mean(temperature)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    month = factor(\n      month_name,\n      levels = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\")\n    ),\n    location = factor(\n      location, levels = c(\"Death Valley\", \"Houston\", \"San Diego\", \"Chicago\")\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-month_name)\n\nColor Scales Exercise Solutions"

Verify that adding this theme to the plot makes no difference in the output. Then change the overall font size by providing the theme function with a numeric font size argument, e.g. theme_gray(16).\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  ___\n\nThe ggplot2 package has many built-in themes, including theme_minimal(), theme_bw(), theme_void(), theme_dark(). Try these different themes on the above plot. Also try again changing the font size. You can see all themes provided by ggplot2 here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nMany other packages also provide themes. For example, the cowplot package provides themes theme_half_open(), theme_minimal_grid(), theme_minimal_hgrid(), and theme_minimal_vgrid(). You can see all cowplot themes here: https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/themes.html\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nCompare the visual appearance of theme_minimal() from ggplot2 to theme_minimal_grid() from cowplot. What similarities and differences to you notice? Which do you prefer? (There is no correct answer here, just be aware of the differences and of your preferences.)\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\n\n\nModifying theme elements\nYou can modify theme elements by adding a theme() call to the plot. Inside the theme() call you specify which theme element you want to modify (e.g., axis.title, axis.text.x, panel.background, etc) and what changes you want to make. For example, to make axis titles blue, you would write:\n\ntheme(\n  axis.title = element_text(color = \"blue\")\n)\n\nThere are many theme settings, and for each one you need to know what type of an element it is (element_text(), element_line(), element_rect() for text, lines, or rectangles, respectively). A complete description of the available options is available at the ggplot2 website: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html\nHere, we will only try a few simple things. For example, see if you can make the legend title blue and the legend text red.\n\n# make the legend title blue and the legend text red\nggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nNow color the area behind the legend in \"aliceblue\". Hint: The theme element you need to change is called legend.background. There is also an element legend.box.background but it is only visible if legend.background is not shown, and in the default ggplot2 themes that is not the case.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nAnother commonly used feature in themes are margins. Many parts of the plot theme can understand customized margins, which control how much spacing there is between different parts of a plot. Margins are typically specified with the function margin(), which takes four numbers specifying the margins in points, in the order top, right, bottom, left. So, margin(10, 5, 5, 10) would specify a top margin of 10pt, a right margin of 5pt, a bottom margin of 5pt, and a left margin of 10pt.\nTry this out by setting the legend margin (element legend.margin) such that there is no top and no bottom margin but 10pt left and right margin.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nThere are many other things you can do. Try at least some of the following:\n\nChange the horizontal or vertical justification of text with hjust and vjust.\nChange the font family with family.1\nChange the panel grid. For example, create only horizontal lines, or only vertical lines.\nChange the overall margin of the plot with plot.margin.\nMove the position of the legend with legend.position and legend.justification.\nTurn off some elements by setting them to element_blank().\n\n1 Getting fonts to work well can be tricky in R. Which specific fonts work depends on the graphics device and the operating system. You can try some of the following fonts and see if they work on app.terra.bio: \"Palatino\", \"Times\", \"Helvetica\", \"Courier\", \"ITC Bookman\", \"ITC Avant Garde Gothic\", \"ITC Zapf Chancery\".\n\n\nWriting your own theme\nYou can write a theme by\n\ntheme_colorful &lt;-\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(color = \"mediumblue\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"springgreen4\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(color = \"firebrick4\")\n  )\n\nHint: Do you have to add theme_colorful or theme_colorful()? Do you understand which option is correct and why? If you are unsure, try both and see what happens.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nNow write your own theme and then add it to the penguing plot.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nFigure Design Exercise Solutions"

We will also be using the package patchwork for plot composition.\n\n# load required library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nWe will be working with the dataset mtcars, which contains fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).\n\nmtcars\n\n                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4           21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag       21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710          22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive      21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout   18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant             18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nDuster 360          14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4\nMerc 240D           24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.190 20.00  1  0    4    2\nMerc 230            22.8   4 140.8  95 3.92 3.150 22.90  1  0    4    2\nMerc 280            19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C           17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\nMerc 450SE          16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SL          17.3   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SLC         15.2   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00  0  0    3    3\nCadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4\nLincoln Continental 10.4   8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4\nChrysler Imperial   14.7   8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4\nFiat 128            32.4   4  78.7  66 4.08 2.200 19.47  1  1    4    1\nHonda Civic         30.4   4  75.7  52 4.93 1.615 18.52  1  1    4    2\nToyota Corolla      33.9   4  71.1  65 4.22 1.835 19.90  1  1    4    1\nToyota Corona       21.5   4 120.1  97 3.70 2.465 20.01  1  0    3    1\nDodge Challenger    15.5   8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87  0  0    3    2\nAMC Javelin         15.2   8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30  0  0    3    2\nCamaro Z28          13.3   8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4\nPontiac Firebird    19.2   8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05  0  0    3    2\nFiat X1-9           27.3   4  79.0  66 4.08 1.935 18.90  1  1    4    1\nPorsche 914-2       26.0   4 120.3  91 4.43 2.140 16.70  0  1    5    2\nLotus Europa        30.4   4  95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5    2\nFord Pantera L      15.8   8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50  0  1    5    4\nFerrari Dino        19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6\nMaserati Bora       15.0   8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60  0  1    5    8\nVolvo 142E          21.4   4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60  1  1    4    2\n\n\n\nCombining plots\nFirst we set up four different plots that we will subsequently combine. The plots are stored in variables p1, p2, p3, p4.\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))\np1  \n\n\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))\np2\n\n\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_smooth(aes(disp, qsec))\np3\n\n\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_bar(aes(carb))\np4\n\n\n\n\nTo show plots side-by-side, we use the operator |, as in p1 | p2. Try this by making a compound plot of plots p1, p2, p3 side-by-side.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nTo show plots on top of one-another, we use the operator /, as in p1 / p2. Try this by making a compound plot of plots p1, p2, p3 on top of each other.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nWe can also use parentheses to group plots with respect to the operators | and /. For example, we can place several plots side-by-side and then place this entire row of plots on top of another plot. Try putting p1, p2, p3, on the top row, and p4 on the bottom row.\n\n(___) / ___\n\n\n\nPlot annotations\nThe patchwork package provides a powerful annotation system via the plot_annotation() function that can be added to a plot assembly. For example, we can add plot tags (the labels in the upper left corner identifying the plots) via the plot annotation tag_levels. You can set tag_levels = \"A\" to generate tags A, B, C, etc. Try this out.\n\n(p1 | p2 | p3 ) / p4\n\n\n\n\nTry also tag levels such as \"a\", \"i\", or \"1\".\nYou can also add elements such as titles, subtitles, and captions, by setting the title, subtitle, or caption argument in plot_annotation(). Try this out by adding an overall title to the figure from the previous exercise.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nAlso set a subtitle and a caption.\nFinally, you can change the theme of all plots in the plot assembly via the & operator, as in (p1 | p2) & theme_bw(). Try this out.\n\n # build all the code for this exercise\n\nWhat happens if you write this expression without parentheses? Do you understand why?\n(Big) Challenge Problem:\nIf you have time this morning, or if you want to work on it this afternoon, try analyzing a new dataset to test your R skills. First, learn what the columns mean, what missing values you see, and then start to ask questions about patterns in the data by making plots.\nYou can browse the datasets at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data (click on a year folder and go to the README to read about the datasets). Or pick from one of the ones below:\n\n# fish consumption in different countries \nconsumption &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-10-12/fish-and-seafood-consumption-per-capita.csv')\n\n# world cup Cricket matches from 1996 to 2005\nmatches &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-11-30/matches.csv')\n\n# malaria deaths by age across the world and time. \n malaria_deaths&lt;- readr::read_csv('https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-11-13/malaria_deaths_age.csv')\n\n#meteorites and/or volcanos:\n# note to plot a map, try the following:\ncountries_map &lt;- ggplot2::map_data(\"world\")\nworld_map&lt;-ggplot() + \n  geom_map(data = countries_map, \n           map = countries_map,aes(x = long, y = lat, map_id = region, group = group),\n           fill = \"white\", color = \"black\", size = 0.1) # then add geom_point() to this map to add lat/long points\n\nmeteorites &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-11/meteorites.csv\")\nvolcano &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/volcano.csv\")\n\n# or pick any dataset from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data , \n# just click on a year folder and go to the README to read about the datasets\n# if you have trouble loading a dataset there, ask for help!\n\nCompound Figures Exercise Solutions"

Oftentimes parameter and arugument are used interchangably, even though techincally parameter refers to the variable and argument refers to the value.\nAssignment operator: Symbol that assigns values on the right to an object on the left. Looks like &lt;-. Keyboard shortcut is Alt + -\nComment: Text written in a script that is not treated as code to be run, but rather as text that describes what the code is doing. These are usually short notes, beginning with a #\nComprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): A public repository of R packages.\nData frame: A two-dimensional data structure for storing tabular data in memory. Rows represent records and columns represent variables.\nFunction: A code block which gathers a sequence of operations into a whole, preserving it for ongoing use by defining a set of tasks that takes zero or more required and optional arguments as inputs and returns expected outputs (return values), if any. Functions enable repeating these defined tasks with one command, known as a function call.\nNA: A special value used to represent data that is not available.\nPipe operator: The %&gt;% used to make the output of one function the input of the next.\nPackage: A collection of code, data, and documentation that can be distributed and re-used. Also referred to in some languages as a library or module.\nParameter: A variable specified in a function definition whose value is passed to the function when the function is called. Parameters and arguments are distinct, but related concepts. Parameters are variables and arguments are the values assigned to those variables. In practice though these terms are often used interchangeably.\nPositional argument: An argument to a function that gets its value according to its place in the function’s definition, as opposed to a named argument that is explicitly matched by name.\nReproducible research: The practice of describing and documenting research results in such a way that another researcher or person can re-run the analysis code on the same data to obtain the same result.\nTibble: A modern replacement for R’s data frame, which stores tabular data in columns and rows, defined and used in the tidyverse. Almost always when you are working with a data frame, you are actually working with a tibble.\nTidy data: Tabular data that satisfies three conditions that facilitate initial cleaning, and later exploration and analysis—(1) each variable forms a column, (2) each observation forms a row, and (3) each type of observation unit forms a table.\nTidyverse: A collection of R packages for operating on tabular data in consistent ways.\nVariable: A name in a program that has some data associated with it. A variable’s value can be changed after definition.\nVector: A sequence of values that have all the same type. Vectors are the fundamental data structure in R; a scalar is just a vector with exactly one element."
