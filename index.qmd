# Data Science for Biology Workshop Series
:::



:::{.g-col-8}

The third workshop in the series is scheduled for **February 24-28, 2025.** 

**Who is it for?** 

For researchers who are working with raw sequencing data studying health and disease who want to build a foundatino of bioinformatics skills. No command line experience necessary, but data analysis with R would be a huge plus.

**Content covered:**

Understanding the outputs of sequencing experiments.

Mapping viral sequences to reference databases.

Building and visualizing trees of viruses.
